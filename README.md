# doppler-module-10-challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that generates a SVG file based on user input. We had functionality that accepted user text as well as user selections to generate a unique SVG image based on said input. We used Nodejs and JavaScript to generate the CLI app.

## Description
This App allows users to generate SVG images that are saved to the local machine.  We prompt the user to input text as well as make selections from a list to generate the SVG image.
